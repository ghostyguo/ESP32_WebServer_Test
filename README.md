# ESP32_WebServer_Test
ESP32 WebServer Library Test

The ESP32 libraries has no WebServer class as ESP8266 does. It can parses and responses to the http request from a web client. This project is rewritten from the library of ESP8266. As the FS in ESP32 is located in SD card, the file stream access (SPIFF in ESP8266) is currently disabled in the version.
